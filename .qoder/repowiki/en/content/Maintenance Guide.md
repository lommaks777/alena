## Routine Monitoring

### API Usage Monitoring
Monitor API usage through Vercel Insights to track request volume, response times, and error rates. The application's API endpoints are:
- `POST /api/submit`: Saves quiz responses to Supabase database
- `POST /api/generate-result`: Generates personalized results using OpenAI or fallback content
- `GET /api/stats`: Retrieves aggregated statistics from Supabase

Use the `/stats.html` page to view real-time statistics including total responses, result distribution, and question-level answer breakdowns.

### answers.json Growth Monitoring
The local `answers.json` file is now deprecated. All quiz submissions are stored in the Supabase database table `quiz_responses`. Monitor database usage through the Supabase Dashboard to ensure storage limits are not exceeded. Each entry includes:
- User answers to all questions
- Determined adaptation stage (A, B, C, or D)
- Timestamp of submission
- Unique ID (UUID)

Regularly check database size and usage metrics in the Supabase Dashboard.

### OpenAI Connectivity Verification
Verify OpenAI connectivity using the provided test script:
```bash
npm run test:openai
```

The test in `tests/openai-connection.test.js` validates that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set and that the API responds to requests. Ensure the key is properly configured in Vercel environment variables.

## Agent Personas and Fallback Content Management

### Updating Agent Personas
The agent persona is defined in the `generate-result.js` API function. The system uses a coaching persona named Alena who helps women in emigration transition from stagnation to movement. Key characteristics:
- Warm, supportive tone
- Respectful of personal boundaries
- Encouraging and uplifting

To update the persona, modify the system message in the OpenAI API call within `generate-result.js`.

### Fallback Content Management
The `fallbackContent` object in `generate-result.js` contains predefined responses for each adaptation stage (A-D). Each stage includes:
- Title with emoji
- Current state description
- Focus area
- Timeline guidance (7/14/30 days)
- First step
- Recommendation
- Bonus suggestion

### Formatting Requirements
When updating fallback content, maintain the following structure:
```javascript
{
  title: 'Emoji Stage Title',
  now: 'Description of current state',
  focus: 'What is important now',
  timeline: {
    7: '7-day guidance',
    14: '14-day guidance', 
    30: '30-day guidance'
  },
  firstStep: 'Immediate action step',
  recommendation: 'General recommendation',
  bonus: 'Additional suggestion'
}
```

### Stage Mapping
The four adaptation stages are mapped as follows:
- **A**: Tourist stage - "While everything is new and interesting"
- **B**: Cultural shock - "The hardest place of adaptation"
- **C**: Uplift - "But still stormy"
- **D**: Recovery and renewed strength phase

The `determineStage` function analyzes answer distribution to determine the dominant stage.

## Data Management

### Statistics Reset
Reset statistics by clearing the `quiz_responses` table in Supabase. This can be done through the Supabase Dashboard by:
1. Navigating to Table Editor â†’ `quiz_responses`
2. Selecting all records and deleting them
3. Or executing: `DELETE FROM quiz_responses;`

The `stats.html` page includes a "Reset Statistics" button that clears local storage data but does not affect the Supabase database.

### Cleaning Old Responses
To clean old responses, use the Supabase Dashboard or execute SQL queries to remove entries based on timestamp. For example:
```sql
DELETE FROM quiz_responses WHERE created_at < '2025-01-01';
```
Consider implementing automated retention policies based on business requirements using Supabase functions.

### User Data Backup
Back up user data by exporting the `quiz_responses` table from Supabase. Recommended practices:
- Use Supabase backup and restore features
- Schedule regular automated database backups
- Store backups in encrypted storage
- Maintain version history
- Test restore procedures periodically

The data contains sensitive user information and should be treated as personal data.

## Dependency Management

### OpenAI Library Upgrade
The application uses the OpenAI library specified in `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "openai": "^4.104.0"
}
```

To upgrade:
1. Run `npm install openai@latest`
2. Test the updated version with the OpenAI connectivity test
3. Verify response format compatibility in `generate-result.js`
4. Deploy to staging environment for validation

### Vercel CLI Upgrade
The Vercel CLI is listed as a dev dependency:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "vercel": "^48.2.9"
}
```

To upgrade:
1. Run `npm install -g vercel@latest`
2. Verify deployment functionality with `vercel --prod`
3. Test both automatic and manual deployment workflows

### Dependency Update Procedure
1. Check for outdated packages: `npm outdated`
2. Update packages: `npm update`
3. Test application functionality
4. Verify deployment process
5. Commit updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Failed AI Responses
When AI responses fail, the system automatically falls back to predefined content. Common causes:
- Missing or invalid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- API rate limiting
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid response format

Check server logs for error messages. The fallback mechanism in `generate-result.js` ensures users always receive a response even when OpenAI is unavailable.

### Submission Errors
Submission errors typically occur in the `submit.js` API endpoint. Common issues:
- Missing Supabase environment variables
- Incorrect Supabase URL or API key
- Database table `quiz_responses` not created
- Row Level Security misconfiguration

Verify that `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in Vercel environment variables and that the `quiz_responses` table exists in Supabase.

### Display Problems in quiz.html
Display issues in the quiz interface may include:
- Layout rendering problems
- Animation glitches
- Responsive design failures
- Text formatting issues

Ensure the HTML structure matches the expected format with proper question IDs (q0-q10) and answer values (A-D). Verify CSS styles are correctly applied and JavaScript event handlers function properly.

### Vercel Deployment Failures
Deployment failures can result from:
- Missing environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- Package dependency issues
- Build configuration errors
- File permission problems

Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages. Verify `vercel.json` configuration and ensure all required dependencies are specified in `package.json`.

## Security Recommendations

### API Key Protection
Protect the OpenAI API key by:
- Storing it in Vercel environment variables, not in code
- Never committing the key to version control
- Using restricted API keys with limited permissions
- Regularly rotating keys

The application accesses the key via `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` which should be configured in the Vercel project settings.

### User Data Protection
Protect user data by:
- Treating Supabase database as containing sensitive information
- Implementing proper Row Level Security policies
- Encrypting database backups
- Following data retention policies
- Complying with privacy regulations

The data includes personal responses and names, requiring appropriate security measures.

### Input Validation
Ensure proper input validation in API endpoints to prevent injection attacks. The current implementation includes basic validation but should be enhanced to:
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate data types and formats
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Quiz Extension

### Adding Additional Questions
To extend the quiz with additional questions:
1. Update the HTML in `quiz.html` with new question elements
2. Ensure each question has a unique ID (e.g., q11, q12)
3. Add corresponding answer options (A, B, C, D)
4. Update the result generation logic in `generate-result.js` to account for new questions
5. Test the updated quiz flow

Maintain the existing answer value convention (A, B, C, D) for consistency.

### Adaptation Stage Updates
To modify or add adaptation stages:
1. Update the `fallbackContent` object in `generate-result.js` with new stage content
2. Modify the `determineStage` function to account for new answer patterns
3. Update the stage mapping in documentation
4. Test with various answer combinations to ensure proper stage determination

Ensure new stages follow the same content structure and formatting guidelines.
